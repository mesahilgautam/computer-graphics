# computer-graphics-from-scratch

I am very very interested to learn Computer Graphics, and program it for
my liveihood hopefully, because I don't want to become a web programmer. There
are a lot of them already, and open source projects like libreoffice need more
C++ programmers.

Therefore I would like to venture into this world. I started with [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/v3/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), but
found that it doesn't have sufficient explainations for the concepts. Then I found out about
[Computer Graphics from Scratch](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/) from the
`#C++-General` IRC channel, and It's just amazing. It is very well written from the explainations
to the approach to solving problems.

It doesn't provide some solid code samples to refer to, just pseudocode for the functions,
which is nice, considering if sourcecode was provided, then someone like me would just
look at it and retype it down.

So using [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/v3/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) as the base for code implementation/ideas,
and the better one for explainations and examples to implement and become happy.

All the topics from the "Computer Grap..." book are implemented in different brances
with explainations and problems documented in the readme.

All the best!
