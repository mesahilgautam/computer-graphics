### Approach 1:

reduce the number of objects on the scene to check what's the problem.
Also play around with the object, changing its size etc, to see if it
gives some hint about where the bug might be.

> yes it did make the things clear, but still no clue on where the problem

### Approach 2:

There are 2 problems,
a) the spheres are more like ovals, so what can be causing that.
b) The sphere is cut off from the left, and is showing on the right.
